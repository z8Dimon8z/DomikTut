# Project Structure

## Purpose
This document describes the full directory and file structure of the project.
It is intended as a navigation reference for both developers and AI agents.
When in doubt about where to place a file or find existing logic — consult this document first.

## Layer Responsibilities

### `index.php`
Single entry point for all HTTP requests.
Bootstraps the application, loads config, initializes the router, dispatches the request to a controller.
Contains no business logic.

### `app/`
All server-side PHP application code. Organized by responsibility layer.

| Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `controllers/` | Receive request → call validator/model/service → pass data to template |
| `models/` | All SQL queries and database access. One file per entity (post, user, etc.) |
| `services/` | Isolated application logic: file uploads, image processing, Editor.js data handling |
| `validators/` | Validate and sanitize external input. Return structured error arrays |
| `helpers/` | Small stateless utility functions reused across the project |
| `core/` | Router, DB connection (PDO), template renderer, app bootstrap |

### `config/`
Configuration files loaded at startup.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `app.php` | Defines `ROOT` (absolute path to project root) and `HOST` (base URL). Global app settings |
| `database.php` | Database driver, path to SQLite file, PDO connection options |
| `routes.php` | All route definitions: method + URL pattern → controller + action |

### `database/`
Everything related to the database.

| File / Dir | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `database.sqlite` | The SQLite database file. Not committed to git in production |
| `schema.sql` | Authoritative schema. Reflects the current state of all tables |
| `seeds.sql` | Development seed data for populating the DB with test content |
| `migrations/` | Sequential SQL files for schema changes. Named by date or version |

### `assets/`
All frontend static files served directly to the browser.

#### `assets/css/`
Styles organized in layers, loaded in strict order:
1. `base/vars.css` — CSS variables (colors, spacing, typography, transitions)
2. `base/reset.css` — browser normalization
3. `base/base.css` — global element defaults
4. `blocks/` — BEM block styles (one file per block)
5. `sections/` — page section styles (one file per section)
6. `utils/` — utility classes (`sr-only`, etc.)

#### `assets/js/`
JavaScript organized as ES Modules.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.js` | Entry point. Imports all modules and calls their `init*` functions inside `DOMContentLoaded` |
| `modules/` | One file per feature or component. Each exports an `init*` function |

#### `assets/img/`
Raster images used in the interface (jpg, png). User-uploaded files go to `uploads/`, not here.

#### `assets/icons/`
SVG icons. May be organized as individual files or an SVG sprite.

### `uploads/`
Stores all user-uploaded files (images, attachments).
This directory is writable by the server.
It is not committed to git — excluded via `.gitignore`.
File handling logic lives in `app/services/`.

### `prototypes/`
Standalone static HTML pages for design and layout exploration.
These are not connected to the PHP application.
Used as a visual reference during development.
Prototype assets (css, js, img) are self-contained and not shared with `assets/`.

### `storage/`
Server-generated files.

| Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `logs/` | Application error logs, request logs |
| `cache/` | Cached output or processed data to avoid repeated computation |
| `temp/` | Temporary files created during processing (e.g. before image resize is complete) |

### `templates/`
PHP template files with `.tpl` extension.
Templates display data only — no SQL, no business logic, no state mutation.

| Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `layouts/` | Base page wrappers: full HTML document with header and footer |
| `partials/` | Reusable template pieces included in layouts or pages (nav, sidebar, pagination) |
| `pages/` | Full page templates, one per page type (home, post, login, admin) |
| `components/` | Small isolated UI templates (post card, alert box, form field) |

### `docs/`
All project documentation. Organized by type and audience.

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `project-structure.md` | This file. Directory map and file reference for developers and AI |
| `tech-stack.md` | Technology decisions: what we use and what we explicitly do not use |
| `architecture-rules.md` | Architectural principles: layer responsibilities, data flow rules |
| `code-style.md` | General code style overview with links to per-language specs |
| `database-schema.md` | Full DB schema description: tables, columns, types, relationships |
| `security-rules.md` | Security requirements: input validation, output escaping, file uploads |
| `change-policy.md` | Rules for making and documenting changes during development |
| `dev-log.md` | Chronological log of decisions, changes, and implementation notes |
| `specs/html.md` | HTML spec: semantic tags, ARIA, accessibility, forms, images |
| `specs/css.md` | CSS spec: BEM naming, file structure, variables, responsive |
| `specs/js.md` | JS spec: module system, main.js, naming, async/fetch, Editor.js |
| `specs/php.md` | PHP spec: MVC responsibilities, functions, PDO, routing, templates |
| `ai-rules/ai-rules.md` | Rules for AI agents: how to work in this project, what to follow |
| `product/product-overview.md` | Product description: goals, audience, core functionality |
| `product/features.md` | Full list of features with brief descriptions |
| `product/design-direction.md` | Visual and UX direction: tone, style, layout principles |
| `product/prototype-map.md` | Map of all prototype pages and what they represent |
| `product/dod-global.md` | Global definition of done applicable across all phases |
| `product/features/` | Detailed specification per feature (auth, posts, upload, editor) |
| `product/phases/` | Scope and task list per development phase |
| `product/dod/` | Definition of done per phase |
| `product/tests/` | Test cases per phase |
| `design-refs/` | Visual reference materials and design assets |

## Key Rules for AI Agents

- **New PHP feature** → controller in `app/controllers/`, model in `app/models/`, service in `app/services/` if needed
- **New template** → `.tpl` file in `templates/pages/` or `templates/components/`
- **New CSS block** → one file in `assets/css/blocks/`
- **New CSS section** → one file in `assets/css/sections/`
- **New JS feature** → one file in `assets/js/modules/`, export `init*`, import in `main.js`
- **New route** → add to `config/routes.php` only
- **DB schema change** → update `database/schema.sql` and add a migration in `database/migrations/`
- **User-uploaded files** → always go to `uploads/`, never to `assets/`
- **Never put SQL in templates or controllers** — SQL belongs in `app/models/`
- **Never put business logic in templates** — templates display only
- **Do not create new directories** without a clear reason matching this structure
- **Specs are the source of truth** for all code style decisions → see `docs/specs/`
